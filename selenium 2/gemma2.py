    ## üì∑ Portrait Photography Tips ‚Äî Markdown Format

**Camera:** Sony a6700  
**Location:** CSUF ‚Äì Pollak Library  
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, 80¬∞F high, soft diffused light with occasional sun.

---

### Instructions:

Generate portrait photography tips for a shoot at Pollak Library, considering partly cloudy weather and its effect on lighting. Use architectural features (arches, walkways, stairs, trees, windows, courtyard) for framing, backgrounds, or light modifiers.

---

### Output Format (Markdown):

- One overarching tip on how weather affects lighting and mood.
- Follow with 3 bullet-point tips:
  - **Bolded title**
  - 1‚Äì2 sentences on technique, location, and weather
  - Camera settings: Shutter Speed, Aperture (f/2.8 or wider), ISO (100 preferred)

---

### Must Include:

- Aperture f/2.8 or faster  
- Base ISO (100) unless low light  
- Auto White Balance unless strong fluorescent light  
- Natural framing from environment  
- Shutter speeds above 1/500s allowed  
- Use weather and time of day creatively

---

### Do Not Include:

- Manual focus (use Eye AF or Lock-on AF)  
- Auto exposure or exposure compensation  
- Apertures smaller than f/2.8  
- Creative styles or filters (RAW only)  
- Tripod use unless long exposure  
- Manual white balance unless fluorescent

---

### Goal:

Provide technically sound, creative portrait tips using Pollak Library and partly cloudy lighting, formatted in Markdown with camera settings.
